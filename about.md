title: About Cryptacular
---
Cryptacular is a rewrite of the [vt-crypt](https://code.google.com/p/vt-middleware/wiki/vtcrypt) library that has
well served some prominent Higher ED open source projects:

* [CAS](http://www.jasig.org/cas/)
* [Shibboleth](http://wiki.shibboleth.net/)

Years of experience with vt-crypt provided insight into what capabilities of the library were truly useful and what
was more maintenance burden than benefit. We have attempted to build out the useful components and have dropped the
overhead. The result is a lean extension library for Bouncy Castle that truly adds benefit in terms of capabilities
and ease of use.
